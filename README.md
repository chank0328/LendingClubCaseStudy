# Lending Club Case Study

Data set is given from Consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

**Objective:**
The goal of this case study is to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques on a given dataset and effectively present findings in a business-focused manner.

Identifying risky loan patterns from Lending Club dataset and gather some insights which can help reduce future losses.
